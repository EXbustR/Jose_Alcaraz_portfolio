		Hello! my name is Jose and i am a working my way up the ladder of the wonderful world of coding. Currently, im studing HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Javascript from freecodecamp.com and Codecademy.com. My relavant skills are CAD, photoshop, Art, basic c++, and designing. Growing up i had developed artistic skills that i had no idea would be very usful to me. My artistic abilities will transfer to web building and web design, just like it has with other hobbies of mine. I like tinkering with things and solving problems. Problem solving is crucial to obtaining knowledge in pretty much any field of work, and i find learning is as important to me as eating your daily meals.
